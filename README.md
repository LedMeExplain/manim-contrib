# manim-contrib

A collection of example mobjects to serve as examples and starting points for using [Manim CE](https://www.manim.community/).

Check out https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/examples.html for better-curated examples of Manim functions. This repository is for mobjects that may be helpful to others, even if the code does not illuminate fresh features of Manim.

Based on https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/issues/914.
